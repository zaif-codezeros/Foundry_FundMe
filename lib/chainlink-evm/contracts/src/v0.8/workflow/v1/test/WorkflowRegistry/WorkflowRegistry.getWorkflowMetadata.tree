WorkflowRegistry.getWorkflowMetadata
├── when the workflow exists with the owner and name
│   └── it returns the correct metadata
├── when the workflow does not exist
│   └── it reverts with WorkflowDoesNotExist
└── when the registry is locked
    └── it should behave the same as when the registry is not locked
